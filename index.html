<h2>Full Text</h2>
    <h3>Was there anything you did in college before working for Hi-Rez or Prophecy Games (Internships/Co-ops)? </h3>
    <p>During school I studied CWP (Contemporary Writing Production), and a lot of it was focused on a broad musical composition. So I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. I interned at a studio in Manhattan one year that did commerical writing for music (writing music for commericals). 
      I also interned at a studio in the Tribeca area, I also went to school in boston so it was close. I also did a system internship at Oscilloscope Laboratories, it was the studio that the Beastie Boys recorded at often.
    As far as jobs and stuff go that was about it. After college I did small freelance things for commericals/trailers and I was working with my ex at the time doing music lessons for kids. But then, I did lots of stuff for Hi-Rez studios which is the sister company to Prophecy Games. I then started working fulltime for Prophecy Games.
  </p>
    <h3>Was there any event or musical experience that made you think you wanted to do music as a career/go to Berkley College of Music?</h3>
    <p>So interestingly enough I didn't even apply until the day of the auditions in my city and my mom was like "hey, you should try out", but I wasn't even thinking about music school before that. I started playing music when I was six, started with piano, and did classical piano for a while. Started writing music around 14 and picking up other instruments and got really into, but I 
      never really thought of it as a career or job. My parents were very supportive in that area. I was definately more focused on software engineering or science even Bio-Med, but I got in when I auditioned so I went to Berkely for music 
    </p>
    <h3>That's honestly very similar to my experience. I knew I wanted to go to Georgia Tech because I was interested in math and science like you and that was the goal to be an engineer and then right as I was applying, someone from Music Tech came to our band class and introduced us to the major. I thought, that sounds like everything I'm interested in, culminated into one major.</h3>
    <p>Oh yea that sounds super cool, If I were to, not to say I would do anything different cause I do like where I'm at, but if I was a senior and I heard about the music tech major I would go for that over a pure music degree. Cause I'm very much still in the tech scene and love the overlap between music and technology/science.</p>
    <h3>What are some skills that you acquired from college that has helped you immensely in your work?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, it's the major I did. Originally I was a songwriting major and I switched after two semesters because, for one I didn't saying I was a songwriting major. I did have friends that did that who are now writing for pop singers, but after a couple semesters I decided I wanted to do something more that just write songs.
      My major was really cool in that fact that it encompassed a lot of these different skills in music: production, engineering and writing. Touched on a lot of composition, slightly on recording and arranging and really preparing me to do any kind of music, not just songs. Cause people go into videogames, movies, TV really anywhere that there is music. And I didn't study sound design at all, I didn't do (in college) any sound design. 
    </p>
    <h3> So if there's anything that you didn't learn it college that you wished you did it would be sound design?</h3>
    <p>Maybe a bit, because the thing is cause sound design and composing and everything I learned touches on each other in a kind of way. Not exactly coincides with everything, but I started here and had to do way more sound design than composing here. So I had to figure that out, but having the skills of listening to things and break it apart and figure it out is the biggest thing that my school taught me. Cause we had assignments that were like 
      "Ok, make a gypsy jazz track", and another week it would be "Alright, make this EDM thing". So there was learning, not exactly sound design, but working with synthesizers and put things together based off listening to something. That and jazz theory actually. 
    </p>
    <h3>Jazz theory is tough man. </h3>
    <p>Yea, I'm not like a great jazz player and I don't play that much jazz per-say anyways, but the theory itself, like working with tensions and harmonal structure.
    </p>
    <h3>It goes beyond jazz.</h3>
    <p>Yea, like classical theory like tonal theory and counterpoint was so much more.. I don't know about difficult, but it was boring. And it's not really useful outside of classical music, where jazz theory I apply all the time and makes me think about what I'm playing or what would be cool to add here, you know chord structure. So I guess those would be the two things that my school gave me.</p>
    <h3> So if there was anything that your school didn't teach you it would be sound design?</h3>
    <p>Sound Design a bit, I would honestly say I would've loved to touch more on actual mixing and recording. Mixing is something that I've always struggled with a bit. I'm doing it a lot more of it lately, but it's always been a pain in the ass for me.</p>
    <h3>It takes a lot of practice. There is a mixing and recording class at Tech that I enjoyed, but I wish there was an advanced class that went beyond just balancing and adding effects.</h3>
    <p>I took probably 3 to 6 classes encompassing recording and mixing stuff, but a lot of it was heavier on production stuff, the actual mixing and balancing stuff you really had to just know what sounds right</p>
    <h3>Yea, its all about your ear and what you can decipher from the music</h3>
    <p>Its definately a bit hard to teach.</p>
    <h3>What is something that you do that someone may think is easy, but is much more difficult to perfect something?</h3>
    <p>So something that looks easy, but is tedious? I'd say with sound design its a bit of both because sometimes it can be easy and sometimes it can be hard. Actually just in music in general when people hear that you do music for games or movies they think "oh, you're doing something you love, that's so cool" It's like "Yes, it is because I get to do what I love to do all the time", but having
      creative block for a job where you have to be creative, that's probably the most tedious thing that. You have to force yourself to be creative in any field is a pain. There are times when I'll write something in a couple hours and its cool. And there are times when I'm two days into something and I just have to scrap it. </p>
    <h3>I definately have that experience. I'll spend so much time on a song that I like, but I keep spending time on it. Almost like trying to over-perfect a song, and at a certain point I start hating it</h3>
    <p>Oh, yea for sure. Always make alternatives. I have so many.. do you guys use different DAWs?</p>
    <h3>I use Reaper mostly, but also Ableton and Protools.</h3>
    <p>Ok, I use Logic mainly, but you definately need alternatives. Because sometimes you over do it, and I think thats the flaw of every artist or any creative setting is not knowing when you're done. You always want to go into it more, but to get back to tedious stuff.. Definately just having to be creative in general. Another thing is some sound design stuff can sound really easy, but it's really annoying to get, 
      and some sound really cool and I made it really quickly. I'll make some magic blast that will take about an hour using some effects, but maybe just like a UI thing like a button can take forever.
      So yea some small sound design stuff that sounds easy is.. it's not even difficult its tedious, yea.
    </p>
    <h3>So how long would you say it takes you to finish a trailer or song including getting the effects, music or dialogue if you need it.</h3>
    <p>So I haven't done much trailer work, but in general with music it highly depends on what needs to be behind it. Usually trailer music is very generic. There's big orchestra, with maybe some chanting</p>
    <h3>Right, and then the loud bass hits DUN, DUN ..</h3>
    <p>Exactly, Hans Zimmer destroys the track. That stuff can be more involved, or it can be really not involved it depends because there are so many different virtual sample packs that are very specific for big trailer work.
      So it depends on how much, I don't want to say cheating... Have you ever seen that meme that was like..? "I was using sample packs, but they said that was cheating so I learned the instrument. They said that was cheating though, so I made my own instrument. But making your own instrument was cheating so I raised sheep to make wool to make the strings and now I'm a farmer"
      So there are tiers of using samples to making your own instrument. So it depends on how much stuff you use to determine the simplicity of things if I'm having to do a full orchestra thing versus like a little bazaar or market track with a couple instruments like a plucked instrument, a little string, only a couple people playing. and I'll write a simple little melody and it's fun and cute and that can take a couple hours. If it's a full orchestra thing it takes longer.
    </p>
    <h3>I noticed in your trailer you have synched moments to what happens in the trailer so that adds complexity right?
    </h3>
    <p>Yea, doing synched shots, yea it always adds complexity. Because with that you have to kind of pre-sketch it a bit and do some tempo mapping and mess with time signatures</p>
    <h3>In order to hit here and here, So let me as you something else, when you have a trailer, like Hi-Rez, do they give you the video first or do they ask for sound and then you have to make it work with the video after?</h3>
    <p>So there are a couple things, and I don't know which things exactly I have on my website, I think there's one trailer that I have with a slow-mo kind of thing. So for that one they gave me the semi finished product. The most annoying thing is timing noise, so for them it's not much to change a second of timing, but for me it's a lot cause that's like a whole beat. So either I have to add a beat or take away a beat, tempo map it so one part is a little faster than the othe, but generally you're not getting a completely finished product.
      For another one I had an animatic, which is not a full animated sequence, but more of a storyboard with a few pictures. So I got one that started like that so I know I'm not going to do the full thing because in the end adjusting the timings is gonna be a pain in my ass, so I'm just going to go for the feel of everything. Because you can't just be like "Hey, this is not timed, so I'm not gonna work on this to it's full extent" You just kind of have to weasel a little bit and give the feel of it before you flesh out the timings. So you have to think
      about trying to convey the feeling of the piece and maybe having a melody or something, but knowing it's going to change, and you can't get mad at it. Because they will change the timing on you a lot , and you just have to roll with it. And sometimes they say its long timing, it's not long timing. That definately puts a lot into it.
    </p>
    <h3>So when you get a request for a trailer do they tell you what kind of music they want?</h3>
    <p>Yea, so they'll give you a reference usually, of if they don't you should definately ask for one, because people who are in music have their own terminology, right. Tempo, Feel, blah blah blah, and it's something that generally across musicians everyone will kinda have the same terminology. People outside of music, the ones who are asking for the music, have a whole different terminology. If they say they want something faster, you're thinking they want the tempo picked up, but maybe that's not what they want at all.
    </p>
    <h3>Right, maybe they mean they want more notes
    </h3>
    <p>Yea either they want more notes or want it more busy. Maybe faster even means like a more exciting feel. So you have to.. reference is really important because it's something you can actually listen to, but then if you can you want to pick on the reference and ask questions because I've gotten a reference where I did something that sounded like it, but what they were more talking about was just the feeling, and I put it too the arrangment and different instrumentation it was using. So I would use cello, and they would say I don't want that stringy thing
      or the hit thing. So it's really important to ask questions if you can get a one on one with the person or a few different reference points. Yea the language is definately a barrier when it comes to people outside of music asking for something.
    </p>
    <h3>Along with this question, how much creative control do they let you have?</h3>
    <p>So I guess it really depends on where you work. So for me, I'm the only audio person here so I have all the creative control for music. The only limit is what makes sense, like I'm not gonna put a rock opera in a game. The one thing, we have a art director, Chuck, and the one thing he said was. We have this bar kind of place and I made it a little jazz bar cause I thought that would be fun, and there's like a piano and flutes and trumpets and stuff. And he said "The only thing is there's no piano in the bar"
      And I said, "Chuck, were not trying to make it hyper-realistic" Like if we were to do that I'd have to get rid of all the orchestra stuff completely. That's also a thing I guess in general like being authentic to something. So if we have like an Ancient Eygpt kind of thing, and I do try to keep it authentic, I'll look up what instrumentation did they have.. And I'll put those it, but it'll generally be on top of an orchestra maybe to obtain a certain feel. When you think ancient Eygpt or Greece or Rome, you hear like an Assassin's Creed soundtrack, but that's really just a guess.
      Maybe they have the instrumentation, but nobody really knows what music was like back then. And even if it was written down, or has a lively music culture its...
    </p>
    <h3>I know what you mean though, there's a balance between what we hear today while also incorperating historical instruments/elements or things that just fit. Like the guy said with the bar and the piano, like having things that aren't neccesarily in the bar, but there's some leniency</h3>
    <p>That was like the one thing that I was like nah...</p>
    <h3>Yea just tell Chuck to put a piano in the bar</h3>
    <p>Yea there was another place with some little goblins and I wanted them to put a radio in there so it sounds like it's coming through the radio. But back to how much freedom you have it really depends on who you're working for. Like if you're working for a movie the director, the editor and it just depends on how much freedom they want to give you. Does the director like music a lot, is he going to work with you on it, or is he gonna say this has to be very specific because in my mind it's this, so it's completely up to whoever you are working for</p>
    <h3> This is so general, but do you have any tips for people coming into the industry. So you touched on stuff you wished you learned in college and did more of is there anything that once you had gotten to your job you thought "Oh, I wished I had known that"</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I felt pretty prepared from my school. I felt like I was able to take anything and run with it, but just I guess, to be very open to what you want to do. I have friends that aren't neccessarily doing what they want. So I have a friend that does sound design for casino game stuff and he wants to do more composing, but if you have a background in something like that you can move foward to figuring that thing out. I think just being open to oppurtunities that are adjacent to what you want to do, not neccesarily completely what you want to do. It's definately helpful, atleast at the beginning,
      to figure out... When I left I didn't think I would do videogames, I just thought "whatever I can do will be cool". I wanted to work at that commerical place in New York, but I didn't get a return from them. So I did some freelance and stuff and get every opportunity that I can. Whether it was my ex-girlfriends music lesson thing or making a small jingle for her or a sound library, just trying to do as much as you can. Don't sell yourself too short obviously, there's people in the beginning that will do stuff for free. Like I had a friend who agreed to do a whole documentary under an actual company for free.
      Like that's a lot of music and he ended up quitting. So to a point be willing to take any opportunity.
